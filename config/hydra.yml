# Ory Hydra Configuration
#
#
# !!WARNING!!
# This configuration file is for documentation purposes only. Do not use it in production. As all configuration items
# are enabled, it will not work out of the box either.
#
#
# Ory Hydra can be configured using a configuration file and passing the file location using `--config path/to/config.yaml`.
# Per default, Ory Hydra will look up and load file ~/.hydra.yaml. All configuration keys can be set using environment
# variables as well.
#
# Setting environment variables is easy:
#
## Linux / OSX
#
# $ export MY_ENV_VAR=foo
# $ hydra ...
#
# alternatively:
#
# $ MY_ENV_VAR=foo hydra ...
#
## Windows
#
### Command Prompt
#
# > set MY_ENV_VAR=foo
# > hydra ...
#
### Powershell
#
# > $env:MY_ENV_VAR="foo"
# > hydra ...
#
## Docker
#
# $ docker run -e MY_ENV_VAR=foo oryd/hydra:...
#
#
# Assuming the following configuration layout:
#
# serve:
#   public:
#     port: 4444
#     something_else: foobar
#
# Key `something_else` can be set as an environment variable by uppercasing it's path:
#   `serve.public.port.somethihng_else` -> `SERVE.PUBLIC.PORT.SOMETHING_ELSE`
# and replacing `.` with `_`:
#   `serve.public.port.somethihng_else` -> `SERVE_PUBLIC_PORT_SOMETHING_ELSE`
#
# Environment variables always override values from the configuration file. Here are some more examples:
#
# Configuration key | Environment variable |
# ------------------|----------------------|
# dsn               | DSN                  |
# serve.admin.host  | SERVE_ADMIN_HOST     |
# ------------------|----------------------|
#
#
# List items such as
#
# secrets:
#   system:
#     - this-is-the-primary-secret
#     - this-is-an-old-secret
#     - this-is-another-old-secret
#
# must be separated using `,` when using environment variables. The environment variable equivalent to the code section#
# above is:
#
# Linux/macOS: $ export SECRETS_SYSTEM=this-is-the-primary-secret,this-is-an-old-secret,this-is-another-old-secret
# Windows: > set SECRETS_SYSTEM=this-is-the-primary-secret,this-is-an-old-secret,this-is-another-old-secret
